                and disclosure of Personal Information and data collected online by Opinionetwork
                . For some services, we collect and transfer Personal Information to third parties

                <br />
                <br />
                Precision Sample collects information on Opinionetwork that relates to identified
                or identifiable individuals, including information that individuals or jurisdictions
                (such as the EU) may consider ‘sensitive personal information’ (this information
                is collectively referred to as “Personal Information”). “Aggregated Data” refers
                to data where we have taken reasonable steps to remove Personal Information such
                that individuals cannot be immediately identified from the data provided. We collect
                only the Personal Information and other data that we believe is necessary to provide
                our service and ensure valid survey results. The following describes the various
                ways in which we may collect data and Personal Information from you.<br />
                <br />
                Please note that some surveys accessible on our Site are hosted by third parties
                and are not provided by Precision Sample. This Policy does not apply to information
                you provide in a survey hosted by a third party. Wherever Opinionetwork collects
                Personal Information, we make an effort to include a link to this Policy at the
                time the Personal Information is collected. Please be sure to read any other policies
                applicable to the collection of your information by third parties.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Registration and Opinionetwork Membership</i><br />
                <br />
                We collect Personal Information from users during registration. Opinionetwork requires
                a unique email address and private password. If you wish to participate in our surveys,
                we will also require that you enter your address, gender, date of birth, and ethnicity.
                We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with your phone number, information
                regarding your personal or professional interests, and certain demographic or other
                information.<br />
                <br />
                The Personal Information you provide is primarily used to support your relationship
                with Precision Sample and our clients. In some circumstances, we may associate your
                Personal Information with additional information obtained from third party commercial
                sources so that we can provide our clients with Aggregated Data derived from information
                contained in your user profile and complimentary commercial sources.<br />
                <br />
                If you consent during registration, we may also use Personal Information collected
                during registration to send you direct mailings, or contact you by telephone, SMS,
                or email about our various surveys and other opportunities we feel may be of interest
                to you. If you do not want to receive such communications or have your Personal
                Information shared with commercial sources, you may opt out by the means provided
                for in the email or mailings, or by following the procedure provided below.<br />
                <br />
                <i>On the Site</i><br />
                <br />
                If you use the “Contact Us” form on our Site we will collect your email address,
                name and other Personal Information you provide so that we may contact you in response
                to your inquiry. Opinionetwork servers also collect a log of IP addresses (the Internet
                address of a computer) to track users’ sessions and analyze traffic on our Site.,
                and although we link your IP address to your Personal Information or other registration
                information during your registration and general use of our Site, if you participate
                in one of our client surveys, the IP address visible to our client will only be
                associated with an anonymous session ID rather than your name or other registration
                information (unless you voluntarily provide any Personal Information to our client
                during the course of the survey). If you do not wish to have your IP address collected
                or used in any manner, please do not register on our Site. If you have already registered
                and you wish to revoke your consent and have us delete your IP address, please contact
                us at the email address below (include “opt out” in the subject line) and you will
                no longer be permitted to take surveys as part of our panel.<br />

                <br />
                For unregistered members, our Site may install certain essential, functional, analytics
                and advertising cookies. These cookies facilitate and improve the functionality
                of our Site, deliver content that is relevant to users, and determine how users
                navigate to, from, and around our Site. These cookies may be either session or persistent
                cookies, and may be installed by us, or one of our third-party partners.<br />
                <br />
                If you are a registered user and opt-in to our web-browsing survey feature, we may
                install additional cookies that are used so that we, or our partners, may contact
                you regarding your opinion on certain things you see or do on the Internet. These
                tracking cookies contain Personal Information, including a unique user ID that is
                linked to your account. Further, these cookies track certain sites you may visit,
                the advertisements you see, and whether you click on certain content.<br />
                <br />
                We may use this and other Personal Information to contact you about your experience
                with such content or to direct you to a survey about your experiences.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Profiling Questionnaire</i><br />
                <br />
                We may ask users to complete a profiling questionnaire before those users are able
                to take certain surveys. These profiling questionnaires are necessary to ensure
                we can provide our clients with survey participants meeting the criteria identified
                by our clients. The content of the questionnaire varies depending on the nature
                of the survey and questions we ask. Some profiling questions may require users to
                provide sensitive Personal Information if the user chooses to complete the questionnaire.
                We may occasionally share certain answers to the profiling questionnaires with our
                clients on an anonymous basis, to enrich survey results or for other common research
                industry practices.<br />
                <br />
                Users may choose not to respond to questions in a profiling questionnaire that request
                Personal Information. If you do not wish to provide Personal Information, do not
                submit the questionnaire or answer any questions that request Personal Information.
                Individual responses may be submitted and saved even if you do not complete the
                questionnaire. Your submission of any Personal Information manifests your ‘opt-in’
                consent to the transmission and processing of this information in accordance with
                the terms of this and any other applicable policies.<br />
                <br />
                Personal Information requested in a profiling questionnaire is collected for the
                purpose of validating survey responses and ensuring survey panels are comprised
                of users who fit specific criteria. Personal Information collected through the profiling
                questionnaire may be retained as part of a user’s profile.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Survey Responses</i><br />
                <br />
                Many surveys linked to by Opinionetwork are not hosted by Opinionetwork and you
                may leave Opinionetwork when taking such surveys. We do not collect, have access
                to, or control over any Personal Information you provide when completing a survey
                unless hosted by Opinionetwork. When you take a survey hosted by Opinionetwork we
                may collect a wide array of Personal Information. The Personal Information requested
                by a survey varies depending on the purpose of the survey. Some survey questions
                may require users to provide sensitive Personal Information.<br />
                <br />
                Users may elect not to respond to surveys that request Personal Information. If
                you do not wish to provide Personal Information, simply do not submit the survey
                or answer any questions that request Personal Information. Individual responses
                may be submitted and saved even if you do not complete the survey. Your submission
                of this information manifests your ‘opt-in’ consent to the transmission and processing
                of this information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.<br />
                <br />
                When we host a survey and receive the responses, we will use your Personal Information
                to create a report comprised of Aggregated Data that we will provide to our clients,
                and we may otherwise use responses in accordance with standard market research industry
                practices and guidelines. We do not sell or use Personal Information collected during
                surveys for direct marketing or other advertising purposes. Please remember that
                some surveys may be hosted by our clients or other third parties, in which case
                this Policy does not apply. Please be sure to read all policies provided by third
                parties who may host a survey.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Advertising Partners</i><br />
                <br />
                When you are on the Opinionetwork Site and are asked for Personal Information, you
                are providing that information to Opinionetwork, and your Personal Information will
                be used in accordance with this Policy. Please also be aware that Opinionetwork’s
                advertising partners may have links on our Site that will cause you to leave our
                Site and connect you to third party sites that may also collect Personal Information
                from you. The information practices of websites linked to by Opinionetwork.com,
                either through advertisements or other hyperlinks, are not covered by this Policy.<br />

                <br />
                Personal Information we collect may be disclosed to a variety of parties, depending
                upon the purpose for which the information was provided and the context in which
                it was provided. The following describes how we may share the Personal Information
                we receive through our Site.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Registration Information</i><br />
                <br />
                If you register with our Site, your Personal Information will be aggregated and
                maintained as part of your profile. Unless we have your permission or are required
                by law, we may share Personal Information collected during registration with our
                agents, contractors or our business partners who perform essential services on our
                behalf. We may share Aggregated Data with other third parties, such as a client
                who requested that we host a survey. In some circumstances, we may share Personal
                Information with commercial data suppliers so that we can obtain additional information
                relevant to a survey, to better validate your survey responses, so that we may share
                additional Aggregated Data with our clients, or for other business purposes.<br />
                <br />
                We may contact you via email, postal mail, telephone or SMS. However, all emails
                you receive from Opinionetwork and our partners will come from Opinionetwork or
                Precision Sample, so you can easily distinguish all emails that come from us. Opting
                out of any email from Opinionetwork or one of our partners will stop all emails
                being sent by Opinionetwork and our partners. Opinionetwork and our partners will
                promptly honor opt-out requests.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Profiling Questionnaire</i><br />
                <br />
                Any Personal Information you provide in a profiling questionnaire may be shared
                with clients for the purpose of survey validation. We may also share your responses
                with agents, contractors or our business partners for the purpose of performing
                essential services on our behalf. Your questionnaire responses are linked to your
                survey using a randomly generated ID number, and we do not share your name when
                we share your responses to a profiling questionnaire.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Survey Information</i><br />
                <br />
                Many of the surveys linked to by Opinionetwork are hosted by third parties who are
                not bound by this Policy. In the event you take a survey hosted by Opinionetwork
                we will take reasonable efforts to make this Policy available on the Site. When
                you take a survey hosted by Opinionetwork, we will share your responses to that
                survey, including any Personal Information provided therein, with the client who
                requested the survey. However, we do not share users’ names with our clients. Instead,
                we share a randomly-generated identifier that is associated with the profiling questionnaire
                and survey responses themselves. Please remember that this policy does not apply
                to surveys hosted by third parties, so please read the applicable policies of any
                third-party sites you may visit.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Cookies</i><br />
                <br />
                If you are a registered user who has consented to the installation of our web-browsing
                based survey opportunity, we may share a randomly generated user ID and the information
                contained in or collected from the use of the tracking cookie with certain client
                and survey partners. If a client would like to contact you about completing a survey,
                we will contact you so you may complete the survey if you wish to do so.<br />
                <br />
                <i>Extraordinary Disclosures</i><br />
                <br />
                We may share any of your Personal Information that we possess as part of a merger,
                sale or transfer of our business or substantially all of our assets, or other business
                transition. We may also share your Personal Information in order to bring legal
                action against someone who may be violating Opinionetwork’s Terms of Use or if we
                need to protect our interests, our customers, property, or the public. We may share
                any of your Personal Information that we possess with governmental authorities or
                others in response to a legal request that we believe requires us to do so. We will
                share such information to the extent we believe that request requires. Legal requests
                include, for example, search warrants, subpoenas, and other court orders. We may
                also receive legal requests or orders from jurisdictions outside the United States
                who assert jurisdiction over your Personal Information, in which case your Personal
                Information may be transferred to the requesting country.
