                For each survey you complete at one of our survey Sites you will be awarded with
                a “reward” amount typically between $.10 and $20. The reward amount for each individual

                surveys, may vary based upon other factors, such as your choices regarding the sharing
                and use of your Personal Information. You must complete the survey in full and agree
                to share your data in accordance with the Privacy Policy in order to receive the
                full reward amount. Once you have earned the minimum amount of rewards required
                to make a redemption, you may access the ‘Rewards’ area of the Site. Select the
                desired redemption option from those listed on the Site and follow the instructions
                given to process your reward. The rewards represented in the ‘Rewards’ area of the
                Site and the minimum redemption amount are subject to change by Opinionetwork at

                for, and makes no warranty with respect to, any Rewards provided by Reward Partners,
                or any part thereof. Rewards earned from participating in surveys are valid for
                12 months from the award date. If unused on the 366th day after being deposited
                into your account, your reward will expire and be removed from your Member account
                balance. Opinionetwork will redeem rewards from your account based upon the award
                date. Your “oldest” reward funds will be deducted first, leaving your most recently
                earned rewards in your account.
