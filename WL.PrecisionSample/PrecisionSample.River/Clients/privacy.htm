            <b>1. What personally identifiable information is collected from me? </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Opinionetwork collects information in several ways from different parts of the Opinion
            Network. Some personal information is gathered when you register for the Opinionetwork
            via our integrations at various Partner Network Sites or through our Smartphone
            Application. During registration, Opinionetwork requires a unique email address.
            We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal
            or professional interests so we may target the surveys you receive and contact preferences.
            You may also install our Smartphone App where we may collect samplings of the ambient
            sounds transmitted to us by your phone, internet activity and your geo-location.
            Wherever Precision Sample collects personal information, we make an effort to include
            a link to this Privacy Policy on that page.

            <b>2. What are cookies and how are they used by Opinionetwork? </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Opinionetwork may place Internet cookies on your hard drive. Internet cookies are
            small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies
            are used to (a) remind us of who you are in order to deliver you better service;
            (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Web site to help
            target advertisements based on user interests and behavior; (c) track your progress
            in surveys; and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool
            to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another. You
            can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance
            to decide whether or not to accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Web pages
            may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.
            Opinionetwork also collects IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to
            track a user's session while the user remains anonymous. We analyze this data for
            certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting
            and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything
            personally identifiable to you. In those limited cases where session information
            is not anonymous, Opinionetwork will provide notice of the practice and an opportunity
            to “opt out”. Research companies that you may take surveys with through Opinionetwork
            may also use their own cookies. The content of such cookies and the use of the information
            they contain is controlled by the individual research companies, not by Opinionetwork.

            <b>3. How is my information used? </b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Opinionetwork will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information
            to others without your consent. The information you provide will be used to support
            your relationship with Opinionetwork alone. We may use the personal information
            you provide on your application for internal purposes. These purposes include market
            research, administration of our websites and compliance with our legal obligations,
            policies and procedures. We collect samples from your immediate environment throughout
            the day as well as demographic information. These samples can be collected in a
            variety of formats ranging from recording ambient noises, internet cookies or other
            tracking agents, surveys, and other means. The samples are then combined with the
            demographic data. We want to help you quickly find information on Opinionetwork
            and alert you to specific surveys, updated information, and other new opportunities
            from Opinionetwork. Accordingly, we may send you email communications, direct mailings
            via postal mail, or contact you by telephone or SMS text about our various surveys
            and other opportunities we feel may be of interest to you. If you do not want to
            receive such mailings, simply “opt-out” by the means provided for in each communication
            or by contacting <u style="color: Blue;">Support@Opinionetwork.com</u>

            <b>4. Who is collecting my information?</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            When you are on the Opinionetwork and are asked for personal information, you are
            sharing that information with Opinionetwork alone, unless specifically stated otherwise.
            If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Opinionetwork,
            you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you
            do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by
            not participating in that particular survey.<br />
            Please also be aware that Opinionetwork research partners and clients who host the
            surveys in the Opinionetwork may collect personally identifiable information about
            you. The information practices of those Web sites linked to Opinionetwork either
            through hyperlinks, email communications or SMS text are not covered by this privacy
            statement.

            <b>5. With whom does Opinionetwork share my information?</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal
            data you provide with other Opinionetwork agents, contractors or our business partners
            for the purposes of performing services for Opinionetwork. Opinionetwork may
            share aggregated data with others. Aggregated data does not include personally identifiable
            information.<br />
            Opinionetwork may also disclose account information in special cases when we have
            reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact
            or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Opinionetwork’s Terms
            of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
            unintentionally) Opinionetwork's rights or property, other Opinionetwork users,
            or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Opinionetwork may disclose
            or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires
            it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain,
            service, and improve our products and services.<br />

            <br />
            You can request the individual information that Opinionetwork has collected about
            you, correct factual inaccuracies in your information, remove personal information
            from Opinionetwork’s data bases, and/or update your personal information by contacting
            <u style="color: Blue;">Support@Opinionetwork.com</u> or updating your information

            <b>7. What does “opt-out” mean?</b><br />
            <br />
            To “opt-out” means that you have notified Opinionetwork that we no longer have permission
            to use your information for a particular purpose. For example, when we send you
            information on a new survey, you will be given the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving
            such information in the future.

            <b>8. What else should I know about my privacy?</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            Third party surveys and internet sites hosted by our partners and clients and accessible
            through the Opinionetwork have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent
            of us. Opinionetwork has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies
            or actions. Please be careful and responsible online. If you post personal information
            online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from
            other parties in return. While we strive to protect your information, Opinionetwork
            cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information through the transmission
            process and you do so at your own risk.
