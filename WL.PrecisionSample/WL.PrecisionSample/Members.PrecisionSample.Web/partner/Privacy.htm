Any Registration Data, and Survey Data may be shared with Clients for the purpose of Survey validation, except that this data will be identified by a randomly-generated ID number, and we will not share your name or other Registration Data with Clients.

                <b>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate Events</b>
                <p>Your personal data may be processed in the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation, or sale of all or a portion of our assets.
