  "surveyDownlineFreeToJoin": "SurveyDownline is 100% free to join and you may cancel your account at anytime. Participating in online surveys is an easy way to earn extra money in your spare time. Paid surveys are easy to fill in at any time of the day or night. Even the busiest of people can take a paid market research survey in a few moments. revPhoneNumber SurveyDownline is different than other paid survey sites because we view our members as partners. Without our members who participate in our surveys, we'd have no business at all! Other survey sites may compensate their members with entries into a sweepstakes or a small cash reward that only represents a fraction of the income generated. We pay our members up to 45% of the money we earn from the surveys they complete – a true partnership!",
