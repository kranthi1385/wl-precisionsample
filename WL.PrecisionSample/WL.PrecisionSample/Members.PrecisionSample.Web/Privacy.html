                <p>Your Web browser may have a “do not track” setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not track HTTP header file or “signal” to each site you visit. At present, the Site does not respond to this type of signal.</p>
                <b>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing and Updating Your Personal data</b>
                <p>When you use the Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal data upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate, or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. To do so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@Opinionetwork.com">support@Opinionetwork.com</a> with your name and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed, or if you are a registered user of the Platform, sign in to your account, go to your profile, and make the desired changes. Please note that if you cease using the Platform or we terminate your access to the Platform in accordance with your Customer Agreement, you may no longer have the ability to access or update your information.</p>
                <p>We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. We may also retain your information as necessary to support the Services, comply with our legal obligations, for audit purposes or resolve disputes.</p>
