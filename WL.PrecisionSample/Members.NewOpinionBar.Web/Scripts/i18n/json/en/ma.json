  "p1": "OpinionBar is the leading international online testing community, operated by MetrixLab, one of the world's fastest growing online market research agencies.",
  "p2": "OpinionBar invites its members by email for paid surveys which are conducted online to enable its members to participate in a comfortable and natural way - be that at home or wherever they want to participate. We promise there will be no annoying phone calls and no unnatural and disturbing influences.",
  "p3": "In early 1999, OpinionBar's main focus was conducting surveys about websites. Nowadays, hundreds of thousands OpinionBar members are asked about their opinion on a wide scope of subjects including websites, products, advertisements and services every month.",
  "p4": "As a member you will be invited for all kinds of surveys. Not only the usual questionnaires, but also we will invite you to test products at home (and keep them most of the time!), participate in game-like surveys, sort through images and be the first to see new websites and TV commercials.",
  "p5": "We will credit your account between €1.00 and €10.00 for each survey you complete. Once your balance has reached the threshold to request a payment, you can choose whether you want to receive the money yourself, or donate it to one of the charities supported by OpinionBar. Unlike other companies, we give you cash, not vouchers. It is your money, so you are free to choose how to spend it."
