                A cookie is a small text file that a website places on your browser. Cookies are
                widely used for security, to learn about and improve upon how users navigate a website,
                or to enable certain features. For example, cookies can allow a website to remember
                your password, determine information about the duration of your visit to a website,
                or to serve you relevant advertising.<br />
                <br />
                Cookies have a time limit for which they will be stored. “Session cookies” remain
                on your browser while you are logged on to a particular website and ‘expire’ or
                are deleted from your device when you leave the website, close the browser, or delete
                them. “Persistent cookies” remain on your device for longer periods of time, sometimes
                indefinitely, or until you delete them. Such cookies may be installed by either
                a first party (the site you are visiting) or by a third party (a partner or party
                other than the Site, such as Google Analytics).

                <br />
                Information from cookies can be aggregated and used to determine patterns of behavior
                on a website, to save your preferences, to analyze a user’s behavior when entering
                and leaving the site, or to deliver relevant advertising to a user on another site
                on the web. Over time, data from cookies can be aggregated to create anonymous user
                profiles that identify and analyze your preferences. To learn more about how cookies
                or tracking technologies are used and how they can affect your privacy, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

                You can control cookies or withdraw your consent to their collection in several
                ways. First, many browsers allow you to change the settings such that the browser
                will either allow or block the installation of cookies. You may also delete all
                cookies stored by your browser using your browser’s privacy menu. Further, many
                modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may help protect your privacy,
                although there is no defined response by many websites (including our Site) to a
                do-not-track request.<br />
